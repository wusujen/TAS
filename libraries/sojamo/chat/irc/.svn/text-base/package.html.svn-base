<h1>chatP5.irc</h1>
<p>
the irc package of chatP5 lets you write your own aim clients in java and 
processing. IRC is the acronym for Internet Relay Chat and is a form of instant 
communication over the Internet. It is mainly designed for group (Many-to-many) 
communication in discussion forums called channels, but also allows one-to-one 
communication. chatP5.irc implements the commands described in 
<a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/2813" target="_blank">RFC2813</a>.</p>
</p>
because the IRC protocol is quite complex in terms of formatting commands, 
chatP5.irc implements the core commands, but lets you write your own commands 
with the cmd(String theCommand) method present in chatP5.irc.IRC and 
chatP5.irc.IRCChannel. this might be useful for special commands like ME or QUERY.<br />
take a look at the examples to get a basic idea of how to write your own 
IRC client.</p>
